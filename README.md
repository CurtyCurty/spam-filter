### KEYWORDS (we should use them (explaining them would be better actually) in our report to ensure high marks)
 - MAP (maximum a priori) (what is it and what it's used for?)
 - Curse of dimensionality (what is it?)
 - Bayes' theorem (quick explanation)
 - Naïve bayes algorithm(why is it called naïve and how does it work?)
  - different types (gaussian,multinomial,bernoulli,ou-of-core (how do they differ?))
 - Supervised learning (what is it? how's it different from unsupervised learning?)
